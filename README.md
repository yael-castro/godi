# Go Dependency Injection (No libraries)

Template project based on a layered architecture made to explain how to do dependency injection in golang without using any library.

**Important**
The purpose of this project is to show a way to do dependency injection in golang and not how to structure your project.

It should take more importance to how the dependencies are communicated than to the structure of the project
