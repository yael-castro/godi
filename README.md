# Go Dependency Injection (No libraries)

Project template based on the most common layered architecture style, made to explain how to do dependency injection in golang without using any library

**Important**
The purpose of this project is to show a way to do dependency injection in golang and not how to structure your project.

It should take more importance to how the dependencies are communicated than to the structure of the project

**Notes**
No library is used in this project: The routing of endpoints are made with the standard go library
